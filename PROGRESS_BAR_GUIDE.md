# Progress Bar Implementation Guide

## Current Status

The backtesting dashboard shows progress information but not a real-time progress bar due to Streamlit's limitations with async operations.

## What We Have Now

1. **Static Progress Information**: Shows what's happening during backtest
2. **Spinner**: Shows "Processing historical data..." while running
3. **Log Output**: Real-time updates in the log file showing:
   - Each trade being executed
   - Rate limiting messages
   - Processing status

## Why No Real-Time Progress Bar

Streamlit's architecture makes it challenging to update UI elements while running async operations. The backtest runs in a single async block, and Streamlit can't update the UI until that block completes.

## How to Monitor Progress

### 1. Watch the Log File
```bash
tail -f backtest_dashboard_new.log
```

This shows real-time updates including:
- Trade executions
- Rate limiting waits
- Processing dates

### 2. Use the Enhanced Dashboard (Alternative)
```bash
python3 -m streamlit run src/ui/backtest_dashboard_enhanced.py --server.port 8503
```

This version uses threading to enable real-time progress updates but is more complex.

### 3. Console Output Method
Run the backtest script directly to see console progress:
```bash
python3 scripts/tests/test_backtest_with_progress.py
```

## Future Improvements

To add a real progress bar, we would need to:

1. **Refactor the backtest engine** to use a queue-based approach
2. **Use Streamlit's session state** more extensively
3. **Implement WebSocket communication** for real-time updates
4. **Use background tasks** with proper state management

For now, the current implementation prioritizes stability and correct results over real-time UI updates.
