## Integration with Live Trading

The test suite uses the same classes and data structures as the live trading system:

- `Trade` - Manages trade lifecycle
- `EnhancedTradeManager` - Handles all trading operations

This ensures test results accurately reflect production behavior.

## Next Steps

3. **Performance Testing**: Measure execution speed and latency
4. **Stress Testing**: Simulate extreme market conditions

## Important Notes

- All option orders must use `time_in_force: 'day'`
- Option symbols are padded to consistent length
- Credit spreads require selling near strike, buying far strike
- P&L is calculated as: Entry Credit - Current Spread Value
- Greeks help assess risk but are estimates in simulation
