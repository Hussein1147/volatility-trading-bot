# Phase 4 - Professional Strategy Complete âœ…

## Overview

Phase 4 completes the professional multi-book options strategy by implementing the remaining features from the TradeBrain-V prompt, including iron condors, portfolio constraints, and event blackouts.

## Implemented Features

### 1. Iron Condor Strategy âœ…
- Triggers when IV Rank â‰¥ 65
- Places both put and call credit spreads at 0.15 delta
- Example: SPY with IV=70 â†’ PUT 440/435 + CALL 460/465

```python
if is_iron_condor:
    # Get strikes for both sides
    put_short, put_long = self.strike_selector.select_spread_strikes(
        spread_type='put_credit', ...)
    call_short, call_long = self.strike_selector.select_spread_strikes(
        spread_type='call_credit', ...)
```

### 2. Portfolio Manager âœ…
Created `src/core/portfolio_manager.py` with:

- **Portfolio Greeks Tracking**
  - Calculates total delta, gamma, theta, vega
  - Enforces Â±0.30 portfolio delta limit
  
- **Spread Quality Validation**
  - Bid-ask spread must be â‰¤ 1% of width
  - Credit target of 20% of width
  
- **Event Blackouts**
  - No new positions 24h before/after FOMC, CPI, NFP
  - Automatic detection from events calendar
  
- **VIX Hedge Logic**
  - Triggers when portfolio vega < 0 AND avg IV > 60
  - Sizes hedge at 1-2% of account notional

### 3. Enhanced Exit Rules âœ…
- **Income-Pop Book**: 25% profit target (was 50%)
- **Primary Book**: Unchanged (50/75/90% scaling)
- **Hard Stops**: 150% loss for all positions

### 4. Professional Validation âœ…
Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Directional filters
- Delta selection
- Position sizing
- Exit rules
- Portfolio constraints
- Iron condor logic

## Complete Strategy Rules

### Entry Criteria
1. **IV Rank â‰¥ 40** (minimum threshold)
2. **Directional Filters**:
   - PUT spreads: Price > SMA AND RSI > 50
   - CALL spreads: Price < SMA AND RSI < 50
3. **Strategy Selection**:
   - IV < 65: Single spread (put or call)
   - IV â‰¥ 65: Iron condor (both sides)
4. **Strike Selection**: 0.15 delta targeting
5. **Books**:
   - PRIMARY: 45 DTE
   - INCOME-POP: 7-14 DTE (only if IV â‰¥ 80)

### Position Sizing
- 70-79% confidence â†’ 3% risk
- 80-89% confidence â†’ 5% risk

3. Close remainder at 90%+ or 21 DTE

#### Positions < 3 Contracts:
- PRIMARY: 50% profit or 21 DTE
- INCOME-POP: 25% profit (no time stop)

#### Universal Stops:
- Loss â‰¥ 150% of credit
- Short strike delta â‰¥ 0.30 (when implemented)

### Risk Controls
- Bid-ask spread â‰¤ 1% of width
- Credit target â‰¥ 20% of width
- No trades 24h around major events
- VIX hedge when short vol & high IV
