# AI-Powered Trading Bot Summary

## What We've Accomplished

### 1. **Removed Hardcoded Rules**
- ‚ùå Before: Mechanical functions for delta calculation, position sizing, etc.
- ‚úÖ Now: AI (Claude or Gemini) makes intelligent decisions using the TradeBrain-V prompt

### 2. **Dual AI Support**
- **Claude Sonnet 4 (Anthropic)**: Primary AI provider with advanced reasoning
  - Model: `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`
  - Preferred choice for professional trading decisions
- **Gemini (Google)**: Fallback option if Claude is unavailable
  - Attempts to use Gemini 2.5 Pro (if you have paid access)
  - Falls back to Gemini 2.0 Flash (free tier) automatically
  - Further fallback to Gemini 1.5 Flash if needed
- Priority: System uses Claude Sonnet 4 first, falls back to Gemini if needed

### 3. **Professional Trading Strategy**
The AI follows the complete TradeBrain-V rules:
- Entry criteria (IV rank thresholds, directional filters)
- Position sizing by confidence (70-79%: 3%, 80-89%: 5%, 90-100%: 8%)
- Professional exit rules with scaling
- Portfolio-level risk management
- Event blackouts and special conditions

### 4. **Smart Trade Filtering**
Not every market movement goes to AI. Only high-quality setups:
- Significant price moves (‚â•1.5% daily change)
- Sufficient IV rank (‚â•40)
- Complete technical data available

## How It Works

1. **Market Scanning**: System scans for volatility events
2. **Pre-Filtering**: Only significant moves with high IV go to AI
3. **AI Analysis**: Claude/Gemini analyzes using TradeBrain-V prompt
4. **Execution**: System executes AI's recommendations
5. **Exit Management**: Professional rules for profit taking and stops

## Example AI Decision

When SPY drops 2.5% with IV rank at 75:
```json
{
  "should_trade": true,
  "strategy": "iron_condor",
  "confidence_score": 85,
  "reasoning": "High IV rank triggers iron condor. Technical alignment strong..."
}
```

## Benefits of AI-Driven Approach

1. **Adaptability**: AI considers nuances humans might miss
2. **Consistency**: Always follows the professional rules
3. **Reasoning**: Provides clear explanations for decisions
4. **Flexibility**: Easy to update strategy by modifying prompt

## Configuration

Set in `.env`:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: For Gemini (recommended - faster & cheaper)
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: For Claude (fallback option)

## Testing

```bash
# Test with current AI provider
python scripts/tests/test_claude_integration.py

# Test Gemini specifically
python scripts/tests/test_gemini_integration.py
```

## Next Steps

The system is now fully AI-powered and ready for:
1. Live paper trading validation
2. Performance tracking
3. Strategy refinement based on results

The bot now truly thinks like a professional options trader! ü§ñüìà
