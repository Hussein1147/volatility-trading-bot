# Professional Exit Rules Implementation ✅

## Enhanced Exit Management System

We've implemented a sophisticated exit management system that includes scaling exits for larger positions and hard stops for risk management.

### Exit Rules by Position Size

#### For Positions with 3+ Contracts (Scaling Exits):

1. **First Exit (40% of position)**
   - Exit at 50% of max profit
   - Close 40% of original contracts

2. **Second Exit (40% of remaining)**
   - Exit at 75% of max profit
   - Close 40% of remaining contracts

3. **Final Exit (remainder)**
   - Exit at the earlier of:
     - 90-100% of max profit
     - 21 DTE time stop

#### For Positions with < 3 Contracts:
- Single exit at 50% of max profit OR 21 DTE (whichever comes first)

### Universal Hard Stops (All Positions):

1. **Loss Stop**: Exit when debit to close ≥ 150% of initial credit
   - Example: $100 credit → stop at $150 debit ($250 total loss)

2. **Delta Stop**: Exit when short strike delta ≥ 0.30
   - Prevents undefined risk as position moves against us
   - *Note: Requires real-time Greeks monitoring (TODO)*

### Implementation Details

```python
# Enhanced exit logic in backtest_engine.py
if trade.contracts >= 3:
    # Scaling exits at 50%, 75%, 90%+ of max profit
    if pnl_percentage >= 0.90:
        exit_reason = "Profit Target (90%+)"
    elif pnl_percentage >= 0.75:
        exit_reason = "Profit Target (75%)"
    elif pnl_percentage >= 0.50:
        exit_reason = "Profit Target (50%)"
else:
    # Simple exit for small positions
    if pnl_percentage >= 0.50:
        exit_reason = "Profit Target (50%)"
```

### Exit Reason Logging

The system now logs detailed exit information:
- Exit reason (e.g., "Profit Target (75%)")
- P&L amount and percentage of max profit
- Number of contracts closed (for scaling exits)

Example log output:
```
CLOSING: SPY put_credit - Profit Target (75%) - P&L: $165.00 (75% of max) - Closed 4/10 contracts
```

### Future Enhancements Needed

1. **True Scaling Implementation**
   - Track contracts remaining after partial closes
   - Implement actual 40%/40%/20% scaling
   - Support multiple partial exits per trade

2. **Delta Monitoring**
   - Real-time Greeks updates during position lifetime
   - Automatic exit when delta crosses 0.30 threshold
   - Integration with Greeks data feeds

3. **Book-Specific Rules**
   - Different profit targets for PRIMARY vs INCOME_POP
   - Adjust time stops based on initial DTE

### Current Status

✅ Hard stop at 150% loss implemented
✅ Time stop at 21 DTE implemented  
✅ Profit target logic for different position sizes
✅ Enhanced logging with P&L percentages
⏳ Delta stop monitoring (requires real-time Greeks)
⏳ True partial position scaling (simplified for now)

### Testing

When running backtests, you'll now see:
- Positions exiting at different profit levels based on size
- Hard stops preventing excessive losses
- Clear exit reasoning in logs

This professional exit management system significantly improves risk management and profit capture compared to simple all-or-nothing exits.
