# Volatility Trading Bot

An automated volatility trading bot that uses Alpaca's API and Claude AI for analyzing market conditions and executing credit spread strategies.

## Strategy Overview

This bot implements a two-phase volatility trading strategy:

**Phase 1 - Volatility Spike**: When significant market moves occur (>1.5%), the bot:
- Sells call credit spreads on market drops
- Sells put credit spreads on market rallies
- Targets strikes 1.25-1.75 standard deviations from current price

**Phase 2 - Volatility Contraction**: After volatility spike settles:
- Adds butterfly spreads or opposite-side credit spreads
- Captures volatility mean reversion

## Features

- ✅ Real-time market scanning for SPY, QQQ, IWM, DIA
- ✅ IV rank/percentile calculation for volatility detection
- ✅ Claude AI integration for intelligent trade analysis
- ✅ Paper trading with Alpaca (commission-free)
- ✅ Automatic position monitoring and profit targets
- ✅ Risk management (2% max risk per trade)
- ✅ Two-phase strategy implementation

## Risk Disclaimers

⚠️ **Important Risk Warnings:**

- This is educational software for learning algorithmic trading

- Past performance does not guarantee future results
- Options trading involves substantial risk of loss
- Never trade with money you cannot afford to lose
- Always paper trade strategies before using real money

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**"ModuleNotFoundError"**
- Ensure virtual environment is activated
- Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**"Invalid API credentials"**
- Verify API keys in .env file
- Ensure Alpaca keys are for paper trading
- Check that Claude API key is valid

**"No market data"**
- Bot only runs during market hours (9:30 AM - 4:00 PM ET)
- Check internet connection
- Verify Alpaca account has data permissions

**"No trades executed"**
- Market conditions may not meet criteria (IV rank, price moves)
- Lower min_iv_rank or min_price_move for testing
- Check logs for Claude analysis results
