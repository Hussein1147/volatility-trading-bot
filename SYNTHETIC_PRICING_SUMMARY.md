# Synthetic Black-Scholes Pricing - Implementation Summary

## What Was Fixed

1. **Credit Calculation**
   - Fixed: Spread prices from synthetic pricer are in dollars per share (e.g., 0.3858)
   - Converted correctly to dollars per contract by multiplying by 100
   - Removed double multiplication that was causing incorrect credit amounts

2. **Position Sizing**
   - Fixed: Max loss calculation was being multiplied by 100 twice
   - Now correctly calculates number of contracts based on risk amount

3. **Strike Selection**
   - Correctly uses closing price from market data
   - Properly selects strikes based on 0.16 delta target
   - Put spreads: sell higher strike, buy lower strike

4. **P&L Calculation**
   - Uses Black-Scholes model throughout
   - No artificial time decay factors
   - Correct handling of spread pricing at different underlying prices

## Backtest Results Analysis

The backtest shows realistic results:
- **Win Rate**: 83.3% (5 wins, 1 loss)
- **Total Return**: 1.0% on $25,000 capital
- **Average Win**: $97.03
- **Average Loss**: $-279.11
- **Sharpe Ratio**: 2.31

### Example Trade Analysis

**SPY Put Credit Spread (Aug 2, 2024)**
- Entry: SPY at $532.90
- Strikes: 518/517 (2.8% OTM)
- Credit: $178.27 (9 contracts @ $19.81 each)
- Result: Stop loss hit when SPY gapped down to $517

This was a legitimate loss - the market moved against the position over a weekend gap.

## How to Use

```python
# In backtest configuration
engine = BacktestEngine(
    config,
    synthetic_pricing=True,  # Enable Black-Scholes pricing
    delta_target=0.16,       # Target delta for strike selection
    tier_targets=[0.50, 0.75, -1.50],  # Exit at 50%, 75% profit or -150% loss
    contracts_by_tier=[0.4, 0.4, 0.2],  # Scale out positions
    force_exit_days=21       # Force exit at 21 DTE
)
```

## Key Parameters

- `synthetic_pricing=True`: Enables Black-Scholes option pricing
- `delta_target=0.16`: Targets 16 delta options (84% probability OTM)
- `tier_targets`: Profit targets and stop loss levels
- `force_exit_days`: Days to expiration before forced exit

The implementation is now complete and working correctly.
