- Project Status: Volatility trading bot development in progress
- Dashboard Access: Local Streamlit dashboard, likely running on http://localhost:8501 
- Current Work: Set up initial trading bot infrastructure, implementing volatility trading strategies

## CRITICAL DASHBOARD TESTING REQUIREMENTS
⚠️ **ALWAYS RUN VERIFICATION TESTS** - Dashboard tests may pass but dashboard might not be accessible
1. Run `python test_dashboard.py` - ALL tests must pass including Live Verification
2. Run `python verify_dashboard.py` - MUST show HTTP 200 and Streamlit detected
3. Use `python launch_dashboard.py` for safe launching with validation
4. Check TESTING_PROCEDURES.md for complete testing protocol

## Dashboard Modernization Status
- UI has been modernized with professional dark theme matching Webull/Robinhood aesthetic
- Simplified 3-tab interface: Dashboard, Trades, Settings
- All bot functionality preserved with clean, maintainable code
- Testing suite ensures dashboard is actually live and accessible before claiming success

## Trading Lifecycle Testing
- Comprehensive test suite: `test_trading_lifecycle.py`
- Simulates full trading lifecycle with Alpaca-compatible data structures
- Tests market data, order execution, trade management, and analytics
- Run with: `python test_trading_lifecycle.py`
- See TRADING_TEST_GUIDE.md for detailed documentation
